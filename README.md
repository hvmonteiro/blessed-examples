# About Blessed
A curses-like library with a high level terminal interface API for node.js.
Blessed is arguably as accurate as ncurses, but even more optimized in some ways. The widget library gives you an API which is reminiscent of the DOM. Anyone is able to make an awesome terminal application with blessed.

# Why Blessed Examples
Blessed API documentation is highly technical without providing many valuable code examples.
This repository was created to fill the gap of the documentation, by trying to aggregate every example I could found over the internet, while  creating my own terminal applications using [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib).

# Examples
*(to be completed)*

**Dynamic Form input:** Accepts a JSON file and generates input forms to edit text.
**Input Form:** Simple input form with submit and cancel buttons.
